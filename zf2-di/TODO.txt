 - DependencyInjector:
   - Should parameters be considered when retrieving instances? 
     I.e., if an instance has been previously retrieved, but new parameters are
     passed, do we create a new instance, or return the previous?
   - Detect recursive references?
   - Static method injection?
   - Factory to create definitions/aliases from configuration
